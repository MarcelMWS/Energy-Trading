# A few words about blockchain based Energy Trading

There are many different variants to implement so-called P2P Energy Trading.  There are basically two different approaches that are currently being developed:

- Contract based trading between peers (IF/THEN)
- Distributed, local Aggregation Market (Merit-Order based)
- Value-based trading between Peers (Energy-Signature based)
